      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Tiffany Scott! If I were to describe myself, 
          I'd say I'm creative, resilient, empathetic, and meticulous.
          I am passionate about learning new things, and I take pride in all of the work that I do. 
          I am a fourth year Computer Science major attending the University of Florida, 
          also pursuing a minor in Music Performance. For fun, I make time to discover new music every day and 
          create my own playlists on Spotify. </p>
        
     <p> Below you will find some of the projects I've been working on and some that I have designed.
